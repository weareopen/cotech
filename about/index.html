<h1>Dr. Doug Belshaw</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
  <p><img src="../img/doug.jpg" alt="Doug Belshaw"></p>
  <p>Hello! I'm an technologist, leader, and educator advocating for greater openness and transparency in the world. I now work primarily through <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> and occasionally through <a href="https://dynamicskillset.com">Dynamic Skillset</a>.</p>
  <p>I work from home in Northumberland, the English county of castles and coastlines. I've had a varied career, following my interests and values. I've always got some <a href="/1024B/projects">projects</a> on the go.</p>
  <p>I'm perhaps best known for my work on digital literacies. I successfully defended my <a href="/1024B/thesis">doctoral thesis</a> on the topic and then wrote a book entitled <em>The Essential Elements of Digital Literacies</em> during the time I was Mozilla's Web Literacy lead.</p>
  <p>In addition, I'm known for my evangelism of <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> which is a form of web-native digital credentialing. I've travelled the world <a href="/1024B/speaking">speaking and facilitating</a> on this and many other topics at hundreds of events.</p>
  <p>One of these topics is decentralisation, which I also explored on a very practical basis as Product Manager of <a href="https://moodle.com/moodlenet/">MoodleNet</a>. This involved building a talented and diverse team to deliver the world's first federated, resource-centric, social network for educators.</p>
  <p>I'm trying to make the world a better place than I found it. If you're doing something similar <a href="mailto:contact@dougbelshaw.com">get in touch!</a></p>
